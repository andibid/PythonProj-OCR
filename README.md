# Python Project OCR
 
A Python project for normalizing texts that are obfuscated by visually similar characters replacing the alphabet characters. The project used the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) approach to determine the supposed alphabet characters represented by the non-alphabet characters. 

[tesserocr by sirfz](https://github.com/sirfz/tesserocr) is utilized by this project, which is a wrapper around the tesseract-ocr API for Optical Character Recognition.
